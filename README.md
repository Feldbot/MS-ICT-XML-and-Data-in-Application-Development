# XML & Data in Application Development Final Project

## Class Background
[ICT 4540 - XML & Data in Application Development](https://universitycollege.du.edu/courses/coursesdetail.cfm?degreecode=ict&coursenum=4540) is an elective course for University of Denver - University College's [Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology](https://universitycollege.du.edu/ict/degree/masters/web-design-and-development-online/degreeid/400). This course explores XML formats, manipulation, and programming techniques.

## Project Information
My [final project](https://feldbot.github.io/MS-ICT-XML-and-Data-in-Application-Development/) was to create an application that displayed  data in a client browser using an XML dialect. I chose to use Journal Article Tagging Suite (JATS) XML. JATS is designed for use in publishing journal technical content and has a large vocabulary to describe the metadata often associated with journal publishing. Viewing the source code of this project will reveal the JATS markup structure.

At the time of this project's completion , I had a special interest since I worked on a journal for a STEM content publisher. I found this project fascinating to see how using a specialized flavor of XML markup could help standardize the portability of content across systems and platforms.

## Built With
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- XML
- [JATS](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/) - XML language for tagging technical journal articles

## Installation
* Download or clone the repository and open the `index.html` file to view locally. Dependencies are linked from `index.html`.
* Some browsers, like Chrome, may not display the XML content locally since domains, protocols and ports must match. If this error occurs, try viewing in an alternate browser.
